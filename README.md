"Blank" is a Balatro mod that added new Jokers, Decks, Spectrals and many others - try Blank by yourself, i guess its very fun!

All about stuff Blank is adding:
- 71 new Jokers
- 2 new Spectral cards
- 3 new Enhancements and 5 new Tarot cards
- 3 pair of Vouchers
- 10 new Decks
- 2 new Stakes
- 2 new Stickers
- 1 new Seal
- 3 new Finisher Boss Blinds

Goal of the mod is to increase Vanilla potential and make players play with new crazy and fun synergies.

Shout out to "TooManyDecks", "Maximus", "Paperback" and "Bunco" - many code snippets has taken from these mods, so if you'd like to create your own mod its better to look this four lol. Also they are pretty fun to play so try 'em too.
Join the Balatro Discord server to stay tuned - there's a lot of work to do i guess and a lot of new content I can add to this.
